Run website.py to launch the website.



Description:

The Python based website runs on Flask and can query Mongo (JavaScript based non-SQL database) databases using Pymongo. Python carries out the necessary operations and exports the information in a JavaScript based format using JSON and renders the information onto an HTML based template. The template is able to run python codes using Jina2.

Additional Note:
The Mongo database is not included on this repository
